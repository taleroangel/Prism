# üåà Prism
Prism is a protocol for manipulating LED strips at runtime with a predefined set of instructions in a _Master - Slave_ model

Prism is meant to be extensible in order to allow multiple independent programs to communicate with LED strips

## üßë‚Äçüè≠ Roles

![Roles Diagram](docs/roles.svg)

### Master

### Slave
A Prism slave is a device attached to a LED strip and interprets commands sent by a [master](#master) in order to trigger changes in color. Slaves will always have a [Newton Interpreter](#newton) which contains the inner [registers](#registers) and interprets commands via [libnewton](#libnewton).

- Slaves can have different LED drivers, currently only FastLED driver is bundled `/libnewton/cpp/include/newton/drivers/fastled.hxx`
- Slaves can communicate via different unique protocols as long as the [master](#master) supports them. [(List of standard communication protocols)](#standard-communication-protocols)
## üìú Buffer
The buffer is the main data structure inside the [Prism Slave](#slave), it is an array of RGB values whose size is the same as the attached LED strip, each position of the array is 3 bytes long (one byte for each RGB value) and the contents are dumped to the LED strip with the `UPDT` instruction ([See Basic Instructions](#basic-instructions))

## üìÉ Variables
| Variable                  | Code | Description                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [Newton](#newton) Version | 0x00 | Interpreter [libnewton](#libnewton) version |
| Buffer Size               | 0x01 | Amount of LEDs in the [buffer](#buffer)     |

## üéõÔ∏è Registers
The [Prism Slave](#slave) has two 1-byte read/write registers that can be manipulated and queried from the master

| Register | Default Value                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| X        | Newton Version [variable](#variables) |
| Y        | Buffer size [variable](#variables)    |

Either an RGB value from the [buffer](#buffer) or a [variable](#variables) can be stored inside a register using `LDX` and `LDY` instructions. [See LoadInstructions](#load-instructions).

## üìãÔ∏è Instruction Set
Prism provides a basic set of instructions for manipulating the [buffer](#buffer) and the [slave's](#slave) behaviour.


Instructions are sent from [master](#master) to [slave](#slave) in a **16-bit Big Endian** frame, the first 6-bits correspond to the instruction, next 2-bits correspond to the options and the last 8-bits correspond to the value.

![Instruction memory layout](docs/instruction_layout.svg)

Instructions can also be compiled from a _Literal_ into a _Binary_ format with the _Newton Compiler_ `/tools/newton_compiler`.

Example of a Prism file with _Instruction Literals_:

```
-- Set all leds in strip to white
CLR
RAN % 00
RAN %% FF
FILL R FF
FILL G FF
FILL B FF
UPDT
```

Gets compiled to the following _Binary format_:
```
04 00
0D 00
0F FF	
14 FF
15 FF
16 FF
00 00
```

### Basic Instructions
| Name   | Instruction | Options                      | Value         | Description                                               |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Update | 0x00	UPDT   | None                         | None          | Updates the led strip with the [buffer](#buffer) contents |
| Clear  | 0x01	CLR    | None                         | None          | Clears the buffer, triggering all leds off                |
| Sleep  | 0x07 SLP    | [TimeOptions](#time-options) | Time to sleep | Delay execution for specified amount of time              |

| Name         | Option   | Description       |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------------- |
| Milliseconds | 0x01 MS  | Sleep time in mS  |
| Seconds      | 0x02 SEC | Sleep time in S   |
| Minutes      | 0x03 MIN | Sleep time in min |

### Selection Instructions
Select which part of the [buffer](#buffer) will be modified

| Name         | Instruction | Options                          | Value                      | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Select LED   | 0x02 SEL    | [SelectOptions](#select-options) | Absolute or Relative index | Select an specific LED by index (aboslute or relative. See [Absolute and Relative indexing](#absolute-and-relative-selection)) |
| Range Select | 0x03 RAN    | [RangeOptions](#range-options)   | Absolute or Relative index | Select a range of LEDs (aboslute or relative. See [Absolute and Relative indexing](#absolute-and-relative-selection))          |

#### Absolute and Relative indexing
Values in the [buffer](#buffer) can be indexed by their exact position called *Absolute Indexing* or, if the number of LEDs is unknown, their position can be specified from 0% to 100% which is called *Relative Indexing*

- *Absolute Indexing* is achieved by using the **#** operator. The beginning of a block is specified with **#** and the end of it with **##**.
- *Relative Indexing* is achieved by using the **%** operator. The beginning of a block is specified with **%** and the end of it with **%%**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: _Aboslute Indexing_ causes undefined or implementation dependant behaviour on the interpreter when the index is greater than the [buffer](#buffer) size. If the number of LEDs is unknown and the register values cannot be obtained, _Relative Indexing_ is recommended over _Aboslute Indexing_

## üì° Standard Communication Protocols
### üîµ Bluetooth (BLE)
the _Prism Service_ only contains one characteristic which is the _Newton Characteristic_, this characteristic's value is 16-bit and is Read & Write enabled

When the characteristic is written (in _16-bit Big Endian_ format), the value is interpreted as an [instruction](#instruction-set). Otherwise, when the characteristic is read, the X (MSB) and Y (LSB) registers are returned concatenated in _Big Endian_ format

#### GATT Description
GATT definitions are available in [libnewton](#libnewton):
`/libnewton/c/include/newton/drivers/bluetooth.h` for C and 
`/libnewton/cpp/include/newton/drivers/bluetooth.hxx` for C++

- Prism Service UUID: `a7a37338-0c20-4779-b75a-089c6d7a0ac8`
- Newton Characteristic
  - __UUID:__ `4e639365-9e62-4d81-8e3d-f0d2bde4ccc6`
  - __Type:__ READ and WRITE
  - __Unit:__ 0x2700 - unitless
  - __Format:__ 0x06 - uint16 (Big Endian)

> üí° an ESP32 BLE broker is included, built it with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) inside the `/tools/ble_controller` directory.

## üî≠ Newton
Newton is the name given to the _Prism instruction interpreter_ therefore a _Newton Interpreter_ is required in every [slave](#slave) device.

a [FastLED](http://fastled.io/) newton compatible (C++ header-only) interpreter library is bundled ready to use (`/libnewton/cpp/include/newton/drivers/fastled.hxx`)

### üìöÔ∏è libnewton
libnewton is a set of libraries that contains all the _Prism specifications_ and allow the creation of the a _Newton Interpreter_, libnewton is currently officially supported by the following languages:
- [X] **C** Add `/libnewton/c` to the include path
- [X] **C++** Add `/libnewton/cpp` to the include path
- [ ] **Rust** _(üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Under development)_ The `libnewton` crate is missing the `ParseInstructionFromLiteral` function.
